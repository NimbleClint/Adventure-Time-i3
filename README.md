### Installation Notes
Welcome to my i3/polybar configuration. Please note that these files are not logner being updated and are provided as is. Some rofi files are missing but there is a link below on where to grab them. Everything else should be there, but will likely need some tweaking to get working.

WPGTK has been used to manage several of the files, such as the rofi menus, dunst, and i3 itself. These files have warning up top to indicate that they should be modified by editing the WPGTK template rather than the .config file.
